# VITIC

VITIC is a calculator that takes the tax-relevant information of two indiduals, and returns their maximum combined total that they could together pay on rent monthly.

It utilizes React, Vite, and ESLint. It also utilizes local storage in order to mimic functions typically requiring a backend (i.e. for signup, login, and calculated data retention).
